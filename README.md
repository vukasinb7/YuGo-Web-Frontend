## YuGo Hailing App

YuGo is mobile and web ride-hailing app designed to provide an efficient and convenient transportation solution to its users. Yugo was developed as our college project. Similar to Uber and Lyft, YuGo allows users to request a ride from their current location and connect with a nearby driver for a reliable and safe trip.

With YuGo, users can easily track their ride in real-time, communicate with their driver and many other things. The app offers a variety of ride options, including standard, luxury, and shared rides, to cater to different preferences and budgets.

YuGo also places a strong emphasis on safety rating system to ensure the quality of the ride experience.

Overall, YuGo is a reliable and user-friendly ride-hailing app that aims to make transportation more accessible and convenient for everyone.


## Backend
The backend of the YuGo app was developed using Java SpringBoot. The REST API was designed to allow communication between the app's frontend and the backend server.

For authentication, the app uses JWT and generates access and refresh tokens upon successful login. The app also utilizes Aspect Oriented Programming to modularize its code and separate its concerns. For development we used H2 Database. To interact with the H2 Database, the app uses JPQL and native SQL queries.

The app has three different roles: driver, passenger, and admin. Each role has different permissions and access levels within the app. STOMP Websockets were used for communication between users, allowing for real-time messaging and updates.

The backend layer of YuGo features a Python script for vehicle movement simulation. This powerful tool allowed us to test and optimize routing algorithms, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the app's service.
## Web Frontend
The frontend of the YuGo app is designed with a modern and minimalistic approach, providing a clean and intuitive user experience. The app was developed using the Angular framework.

For displaying maps and locations, the team used OpenStreetMap, this allowed the app to provide accurate and reliable location data to both drivers and passengers. To ensure consistency across the codebase, the team utilized ESLint. 

Overall, the frontend of the YuGo app was developed with a focus on usability and simplicity, while also leveraging modern technologies and tools to improve code quality and maintainability.
## Android
The Android app for YuGo is a native app, built using the Android SDK and Java programming language. It's designed with the same minimalistic and intuitive approach as the web app, ensuring a seamless and consistent user experience across both platforms.

One of the standout features of the app is its implementation of both light and dark modes, providing users with the flexibility to customize the app's appearance to their liking. As with the web app, the Android app also utilizes OpenStreetMap to display maps and location data. 

The app's design is focused on simplicity and usability, with a clean interface that makes it easy for users to understand and navigate the app. This, combined with its efficient use of web sockets, ensures a real-time and reliable experience for both drivers and passengers.
## Testing
Our team recognized the importance of thoroughly testing the app's functionality to ensure it was robust and reliable. To that end, we implemented several testing tools and frameworks, including JUnit5, Karma, and Jasmine.

Tests were performed on core features of the ride service, covering both the frontend and backend layers. The team also implemented End-to-End Selenium tests for ride reservations, ensuring that the entire flow from selecting a ride to completing the reservation process was seamless and error-free.

By implementing comprehensive testing procedures, YuGo's development team was able to identify and resolve any potential issues or bugs, ensuring that the app delivers a consistent and reliable experience to its users.
